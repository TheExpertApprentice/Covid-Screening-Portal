# COVID-19 Self Screening Portal

## Overview

The COVID Screening Portal was developed to streamline the daily health screening process for employees at [Organization Name], ensuring a safe working environment during the pandemic.

## Problem

Prior to the portal, manual screening processes were time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacked a centralized system for tracking and analyzing COVID-19 for over 25,000 employees and students, excluding visitors, leading to potential health risks in the workplace. The cost of acquiring a new, off-the-shelf commercial solution was less realistic due to the financial constraints of the organization, compounding the need for an innovative and cost-effective approach to health screening.

## Solution

The portal automated the process for staff and students to do a self-daily health screening process prior to being granted access to the campus through custom forms and Power Automate workflows, enabling real-time symptom tracking, automated alerts for health anomalies, and data-driven decisions to maintain workplace safety. The solution was integrated with SharePoint for secure record-keeping and campus access management.
